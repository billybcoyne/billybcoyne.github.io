      <h3>Billy Coyne</h3>
      <h3>Computer Science - City, University of London</h3>
      <p> I am from South London, and I am extremely passionate for all things technology
	  related (specifically around the gaming sector). I also love martial arts and 
	  combat sports, and I have been doing Taekwondo since the age of 4.

	  For both GCSE and A-Level I have studied computer science for, so I have a relatively 
	  decent knowledge around coding but I want to get better at putting that knowledge
	  into good practice.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Interactive shapes and colours</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project mostly demonstrates a comprehensive 
	understanding of the use of interaction and methods, with the manipulation 
	of variables. In the last 4 days ofthe Bootcamp, I created a program which
	draws shapes such as rectangles, circles and triangles depending on the users
	mouse position on the screen and whether key 'r', 'c' or 't' are held - drawing
	their respective shape. Additionally, I have added a colour wheel and a piece 
	of code which allows me to obtain the colour of the pixel on the screen of my 
	mouse postition whenever I right click. My next shape drawn will then be filled
	in with that corresponding colour. Clicking the 'l' key will clear all the drawings 
	on the screen. All instructions for the program are printed in the Processing 
	console.

	I would have loved to extend this project further by adding the introduction of 
	groups/classes and the use of arrays, however time was short to get a final product.
	Additionally, the mathematical side of the coding which mostly included the drawing
	of the shapes took me a lot of time to produce, and I couldn't get the code for the 
	triangles to work in the intended way. I would like to improve on this project in my
	spare time, and see what more I can do.

    <h3>Java Coursework 2022 - Billy's Mind</h3>
    <p>
	This is my first coursework here at City. I decided to make a simplistic enough platformer which is easy to play for all types of players, whilst demonstrating some of the skills and learning that I have achieved in this first year. I also had a lot of challenges, some of them I struggled too much on and couldn't overcome - such as saving and loading - so I had to remove them for the final product.
    </p>
	<p>
	I had lots of recording issues, sadly the microphone I was using at the time was poor quality and the recording stuggled to pick up my computer audio. However, this video demonstrates the platformer that I have created, along with explaining its details.
